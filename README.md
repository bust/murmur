Murmur
======
Murmur reveals and materializes the movement of sound waves. The project retransforms the concepts of speed, space and time by creating a luminous link between the public and the wall, and between the physical and the virtual worlds.

Based on a collaborative and open approach, the Murmur group has gathered around the project since early 2013. Four disciplines are represented: visual design, object design, sound design and a magical touch of programming. The participating studios are Chevalvert, 2Roqs, Polygraphik and Splank. Each of them has provided not only their expertise in their own specialties but also their insights on the other three.
