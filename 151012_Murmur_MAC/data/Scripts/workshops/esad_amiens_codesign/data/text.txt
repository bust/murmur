Car Crash Studies, a thought provoking photographic study of cars that have been involved in severe and potentially fatal accidents. The series moves between documentation and abstraction. While the car crash studies are typographical in nature, seeming in some instances to be closer to sterile accident report photographs, the subject matter most obviously begs the viewer to confront the human fear of trauma and death.
Several of the images are vividly abstract and look more like landscapes than
slashed up metal. Collided bodyworks, dents and cracks in varnish appear as highly
enlarged details in the monumental works. These 'color plains' become the ultimate
instance of beauty created from suffering, pain and destruction.

Although Car Crash Studies is specifically based on cars that have been involved in
accidents, Howalt's works rather attempt to portray an abstract, mental state,
namely the duality we feel in relation to accidents or catastrophes when experienced
from a distance - as spectators. The exhibition at Bruce Silverstein Gallery thus
approaches classical themes, but in contemporary interpretation.

In the photographic projects How to Hunt and Tree Zone Nicolai Howalt (b. 1970)
works together with Trine Søndergaard, but they also do separate projects. Howalt's
Car Crash Studies has elements of confrontation and silent contemplation that
reminds of his earlier project BOXER (2003), a series of double portraits of boys
between child and adulthood photographed before and after the match.
